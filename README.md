## Overview

This repository documents my process for developing a professional ePortfolio as the final project for the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at SNHU. The ePortfolio showcases my growth and skills in three key areas of computer science: **Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases**.  

My primary artifact is a **3D Scene Manager application** built in C++ with OpenGL, which I have enhanced to demonstrate advanced modular design, spatial data structures, and persistent scene/database management.

### Self-Reflections

[Journal: Self-Introduction](Journals/Module%201%20Self%20Introduction.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This document is a self-introduction journal for the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course. It outlines my personal and professional background, including experience as an FDNY EMT, hospital security team lead, and computer science student. The paper connects these experiences to my interest and growth in computer science, highlighting relevant skills, academic achievements, and future goals.

[Journal: Career Choice](Journals/Module%204%20Journal%20Career%20Choice.pdf "Journal: Career Choice")

This document is a career reflection journal written for the CS-499 Capstone. It discusses how my career interests have evolved throughout the computer science program, shifting from a focus on software development to a growing interest in data science and machine learning. This journal also covers research into career options, plans for further education or certification, and provides a status update on my ePortfolio artifacts and enhancements in software design, algorithms, and databases.

[Journal: Capstone/Self Reflection](Journals/Module%208%20Self%20Reflection.pdf "Journal: Capstone Reflection")

This document is a professional self-assessment completed for the CS-499 Capstone. It reflects on my growth as a computer science student and professional, focusing on the skills developed through the enhancement of a 3D Scene Manager application. The assessment highlights achievements in software design, algorithms, and databases, and discusses the adaptability, professionalism shown while developing this project, and future aspirations in the field of computer science.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[ePortfolio Initial Enhancement Plan](Journals/Module%201%20Assignment%20Initial%20Enhancement%20Plan.pdf "ePortfolio Initial Enhancement Plan")<br/>
[ePortfolio Wireframe](Journals/Example%20Wireframe%20Neutral.pdf "ePortfolio Wireframe")

This document is the initial plan describing how I meet the ePortfolio requirements. While the plan submitted was not final, it is a solid starting point with clear ideas for review. This assignment may be seen as a way of beginning a conversation that results in a challenging but practical plan to produce an ePortfolio that showcases my skills across the key fields of computer science:

- Software engineering and design
- Algorithms and data structure
- Databases

### Code Review

[Hec Maldonado Code Review ](https://youtu.be/F6xVm5Z9eBU "Software Hec Maldonado Code Review")<br/>


I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk through of existing code and planned enhancements, and it demonstrates the following critical elements for each category:

- Existing functionality: A detailed walk through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
- Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
- Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

[Software Design and Engineering Narrative- Modularity Update](Journals/Module%203%20Milestone%20Two%20Narrative.pdf "Software Design and Engineering - Modularity Update")

This document describes the enhancement of a C++ OpenGL 3D scene renderer, focusing on improved modularity, maintainability, and software engineering practices. It highlights the use of design patterns, code refactoring, and documentation to create a more robust and collaborative codebase. (See Milestone 1/2 Updated Files)

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement
[Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative - Octree Implementation](Journals/Module%204%20Milestone%20Three%20Narrative.pdf "Algorithms and Data Structure - Octree Implementation")

[Octree.cpp](Milestone%203%20Updated%20Files/Octree.cpp)
[Octree.h](Milestone%203%20Updated%20Files/Octree.h)

This document details the implementation of octree-based spatial partitioning in a 3D scene management system. It demonstrates the application of advanced algorithms and data structures to optimize rendering performance and code quality, reflecting growth in problem-solving and software engineering. (See Milestone 3 Updated Files)

### Databases Enhancement
[Databases Narrative - Save/Load State JSON-Based](Journals/Module%205%20Milestone%20Four%20Narrative.pdf "Databases - Save/Load State JSON-Based")

[JsonDatabase.cpp](Milestone%204%20Updated%20Files/JsonDatabase.cpp)
[JsonDatabase.h](Milestone%204%20Updated%20Files/JsonDatabase.h)
[nlohman-json.json](Milestone%204%20Updated%20Files/nlohmann-json.json)

This document explains the addition of JSON-based save and load functionality for scene objects and camera state in a C++ OpenGL 3D scene manager. It showcases skills in modular design, data persistence, and integrating new features into an existing software system to enhance usability and maintainability. (See Milestone 4 Updated Files)
